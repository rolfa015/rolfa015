# Hi there :wave:

My name is Rolf and I'm a tech guy located on top of the world, more acurate in Tromsoe, Norway. I usually spend my days at UiT the Arctic University of Norway where I work at the IT-department. In my spare time I like to go hiking in the mountains, skiing, watch football or play around with some Home Automation an Arduino stuff.
